# Sentiment Analysis with Self-built Naive Bayes Classifier
## Introduction
To enhance my understanding in probabilistic machine learning classifier, I decided to initiate this sentiment analysis project. In this binary classification project, I attempted to build a Naive Bayes Classifier from sctrach. I used the NLTK movie review corpus. 
Reviews are separated into a training set (80% of the data) and a development set (10% of the data). Within each set, reviews are sorted by sentiment (positive/negative). The files are already tokenized. Each review is in its own file.

## Notes
- In the Feature Selection process, I selected the features by computing mutual infomation for each word
- For classifier evaluation, I created a confusion maxtrix that takes 'negative' as 0 and 'positive' as 1. Additionally, 
I computed precision, recall, and F1 score for each class, as well as the overall accuracy. I personally evaluated the classifier based on precision and recall

## Two assumptions of Naive Bayes model
Naive Bayes is a generative model that makes 1.) the bag of words assumption (position doesnâ€™t matter) and 2.) the conditional independence assumption (words are conditionally independent of each other given the class).

## Analysis and improvement
At first, I tried to use the top 100 features with highest information gain; however, the result turned out to be quite disappointing. Both the F1 score and accuracy were quite low, and the precision wasn't ideal either (as shown in the following graph).

To optimize the classifier, I implemented a self-defined grid search function, which serves the purpose of looking for the best number of features and training the model based on the selected features. Lucklily, this time we derived a result that is more pleasant.
