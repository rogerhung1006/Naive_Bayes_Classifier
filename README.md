# Sentiment Analysis with Self-built Naive Bayes Classifier
## Introduction
To enhance my understanding in probabilistic machine learning classifier, I decided to initiate this sentiment analysis project. In this binary classification project, I attempted to build a Naive Bayes Classifier from sctrach. I used the NLTK movie review corpus. 
Reviews are separated into a training set (80% of the data) and a development set (10% of the data). Within each set, reviews are sorted by sentiment (positive/negative). The files are already tokenized. Each review is in its own file.

## Notes
1. In the Feature Selection process, I selected the features by computing mutual infomation for each word.
2. For classifier evaluation, I created a confusion maxtrix that takes 'negative' as 0 and 'positive' as 1. Additionally, 
I computed precision, recall, and F1 score for each class, as well as the overall accuracy

## Two assumptions of Naive Bayes model
Naive Bayes is a generative model that makes the bag of words assumption (position doesnâ€™t matter) and the conditional independence assumption (words are conditionally independent of each other given the class).
